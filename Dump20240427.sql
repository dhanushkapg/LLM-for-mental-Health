Feelings are only that; your worst fears about who you are are only based on a few moments that haven\'t gone well. Depression is so treatable, but you have to seek treatment from a professional.Here\'s a quick exercise for you to do that can show you how therapy might work... fear is telling you the worst possible story of your life, right? So... if there was an opposite story...the very best story that someone could tell about you and your life...what would that be? Who would be telling it? Someone who loves you? Someone who was around you when you were that outgoing person? Someone who\'s been watching your life from the start? God? Write that best story. I dare you to give it as much credibility as the worst one. Therapy is often about helping people reject their \"worst stories\". I invite you to start exploring with a qualified therapist whatever barriers stand between you and your best life. I hope you reach out soon. :)'),(2,'Q_002','Are there any times or moments in which you feel other than \"empty\"?  Start with knowing the context of when you feel something other than empty.If there is no recent example, then in your mind, go back in time to think of when you felt something other than empty.  Recall what you liked about this time, whether you were by yourself or with others, what type of activity you were involved at the time of non-emptiness.How did you come to your conclusion that your life purpose is to reproduce and die?  If this is what your parents, siblings and extended family believe, it is possible that you have a broader view of yourself and haven\'t yet uncovered a way of defining your own philosophy of living.Give yourself the time to browse around online, or in person social meet ups, on your interests.  It is possible you will discover entire new areas of life and ways of considering life, that are brand new to you and which connect to your true self.This is one way of respecting your individuality, which of itself, may decrease your sense of emptiness.'),(3,'Q_003','Oh dear.From what you write, your husband doesn\'t have any interest to know about you and your sad feelings.Stay clear in understanding that you already did your part by asking him to listen and care about the way you feel.In this example, he told you he doesn\'t care.Its up to him to open his mind and heart to you.Depending on how motivated to continue asking him to hear you, try until you feel satisfied that you\'ve given him enough chances to know who you are.   At a certain number of tries at this, you\'ll either have success or not.Just don\'t try forever because doing so will increase your depressed feelings.'),(4,'Q_004','Hello,While one can be sad from time to time, feeling sad \"all the time\" could be a sign of depression. If you feel sad on most days, it is worthwhile speaking to a psychologist to determine whether you suffer clinical depression. Feeling sadness is a normal response to loss, whether you lose a family, friend, job, or something you deem important in your life. However, feeling sadness all the time is a signal that you are not happy about something in your life. If it is related to your family and often relationship with family members could affect our self-esteem and self-worth, then perhaps it is worthwhile exploring what you find unhappy about your relationship with your family. Is it that you do not feel heard, supported or loved? Is it that you feel disrespected, disregarded or feel unimportant? These are just a few examples of common issues that people report that contribute to their depression. To help you to uncover your reasons for your sadness or depression and to cope with them in a healthier and more constructive way, it may be helpful to contact a therapist who could support you with this process.

Really ask yourself, \"are they facts?\" or are they your perspective on events.  In regards to your coping behaviours at night, it sounds very isolating and also very silenced.  As opposed to the sad music, why not try all music, allowing yourself to experience the wide breadth of emotions that are circling within you.  One of the other recommendations I would make would be to try and journal about some of those thoughts and fears in order to release them in a positively cathartic way. Some of the behaviours that you have mentioned are a bit more significant, though and I would recommend speaking with someone directly in the near future.'),(9,'Q_009','Since you realize that hearing voices in your head is not usual for you, then definitely there is a problematic situation happening within your awareness of who you are.if you recently started taking a new drug or increased dosage of one you already were taking, and the voices started shortly after, then yes, it is possible medication created your problem.Start by telling whoever gave you the presecription, about the problem you\'re having.\"Crazy\" has some flexibility as to whether someone is this way or not.Certainly a very positive sign that you\'re not crazy, is that you\'re self-aware of a problem within yourself.

I don\'t mean to frighten you, but you are right to be concerned. The time right after people leave the hospital after receiving psychiatric services is a time of high risk for suicide. It is very important, after hospitalization, to get follow-up care with a professional as soon as possible. If your husband has an established therapist, this is the time to call. It is also a good time to alert your support system of friends, family, clergy or others to let them know he is still struggling. This is good support for him AND you.It is important to think about means and opportunity to make another attempt. Means really do matter.  So, if you have a firearm in the home, it is really important to remove it. You can\'t remove all things that a person may hurt themselves with, but some things are more lethal than others. Firearms are very lethal. I am not sure what means he used last time, but try to reduce the opportunity for him to access it again. This is where your support system can help out. People can take turns hanging out with him until you are sure the crisis is over.If you believe that an attempt is going to occur, talk to your husband about going back to the hospital. If he refuses, you will want to find out what your options are to have him go even if he doesn\'t want to. I know the thought of that really hurts, but it can save his life. Calling 9-1-1 is always a good option if you are not sure. Usually a suicide crisis, meaning they want to harm themselves right now, lasts a few minutes, hours or days. Sometimes when you get them through the crisis stage, they no longer want to commit suicide. But, as you are indicating, that feeling of wanting to commit suicide can come back again. So, it is always good to have a plan. If you want more information, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. They will always answer: 1-800-273-8255. They can help you create a specific safety plan. I do hope things work out alright. Be well. Robin J.

As long as you\'re in the same state as a therapist offering this service, you could connect with someone helpful from the comfort of your home, even being in your small town. I\'d recommend looking into this option, because you\'re asking a lot of really deep questions and might benefit from having those conversations with someone who can help you find your own answers.'),(14,'Q_014','It sounds like you have been thinking about how past hurts have influenced you, and when you try to talk about these hurts with people in your life, you are feeling invalidated. It also sounds like current conflicts are continuing to leave you feeling hurt and devalued. In working with a therapist, you may be able to get some clarity about your past, who you are, and what kinds of boundaries you want in your relationships, so that you can lead a life that is more satisfying to you.'),(15,'Q_015','These. symptoms are all classic to the diagnosis of depression.A diagnosis itself doesn\'t help anyone get better.  Often people say the word \"depression\" as though it means something terrible.   The diagnosis of depression can be depressing.Forget matching symptoms with a diagnosis.More important to improvement is to know the reason for your sadness.  When people become sad there is a reason for it and knowing this reason is the first step to changing the situation which creates the sadness in you.Think of depression as a way to slow down and examine aspects of your life and relationships.  If you continue at the same pace of living and didn\'t stop and examine your life, then you may not notice what needs changing.'),(16,'Q_016','Have you tried to allow yourself some breathing space to emotionally recuperate from the breakup?Sometimes people expect themselves to bounce back faster than is feasible.  Then, the suffer from both the sadness and distractibility from the breakup in addition to the suffering which is self-induced by not permitting time to feel upset about the loss of the relationship.Be gentle and kind toward yourself because loving yourself will release some of the tension you feel.Since you write that you cannot function and you wrote a question on an online website, maybe you\'re not giving yourself enough credit for your capacity to function.Anyone who is not functioning wouldn\'t be capable to write a question about themselves.While what you write about yourself is in broad terms, my equally broad answer is you may be doing better than you think and the key problem is the discomfort and impatience that the feeling of sadness from the breakup, was more in the past than currently is the case.'),(17,'Q_017','Depression isn\'t something someone \"has\", it is a dark mood and lack of satisfaction with the way the current life is structured.If you think of depression as motivation to look for new ways to understand yourself, find ways which are more satisfying in your work and relationships, then depression is a charm.The typical attitude most people have when they think of the word \"depression\", is that their life will collapse and decline, they\'ll need to take drugs, and feel hopeless.If you take a different approach and work with your depression as a signal to change some major area or one or two minor areas, then you will engage yourself in creating a better life for yourself!'),(18,'Q_018','I am so very sorry for how pressured and sad you feel right now.Definitely all family members have an effect on the other ones.From what you write, your family members are not considering the effect their negative comments have on you.Also, keep in mind that each person is responsible for deciding to argue or find a different way to discuss a problem.

You\'re also right that when you try to focus on just not cutting, it becomes more difficult because it\'s what you are focused on. While that is still something to work on, it may also be helpful to find something else you can do instead. You said drawing doesn\'t work for you. Sometimes more physical activities, such as doing a few jumping jacks, can be helpful. If you don\'t exercise, it might be something to talk with your doctor about first.The more you can learn about what makes you want to cut, the easier it will be to find out what you could do to change that. Try talking to somebody about what you are feeling in addition to the urge to cut.'),(20,'Q_020','Thank you for asking this important question. I find that there are three steps to getting ready for treatment. Step one is expressing interest in wanting to receiving treatment for the outcome of positive behavioral change. Congratulations you did the first step! You are showing your readiness to start counseling by asking this question. Now the second step is to find a counselor who specializes in treating clients with Anxiety and Depression. The therapeutic orientations I have found to be helpful in treating clients with  Anxiety and Depression are a combination of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy with Mindfulness, and Solution Focused Brief Therapy. Receiving meditation for your symptoms if part of the treatment, and the other part is receiving counseling to increase your resilience for future events. Research has found that medication and psychotherapy treatments together shows the most effective outcome for Depression.  The third step is to increase your positive self-talk to motivate yourself to attend treatment. As counselors, we are aware of the anxieties and fears that are associated with talking to a new professional for the first time. However, remind yourself that you are doing this to improve your well being. I hope this was helpful, and good luck with your treatment journey.'),(21,'Q_021','Hi Boise, I\'m sorry that you\'ve lost this love. The fact that you were planning marriage and a future tells me that you meant something very special to each other at that time. It\'s different now...you\'re not together anymore, but you can\'t accept this, right? Good for you for identifying that this situation is damaging your life. You\'ve been grieving for longer than you were together. Oh, but really you\'ve not been grieving...you\'re stuck still loving her instead of moving forward. Unrequited love is a recipe for eternal heartache. Let\'s look at some possible blocks to moving forward.It could be that there\'s something unfinished for you. Maybe you felt hurt and you didn\'t have the chance to say so, or you felt you hurt her and you didn\'t have the chance to make it right. Maybe there\'s a burning question you need to ask or something else you need to say. Maybe you want to tell her you\'ve never stopped loving her, and see if she feels the same way. If this is the case, you have two choices, right? You can reach out and say what you need to say, or you can stop ruminating on that question and let it go. If you reach out, there\'s no guarantee it will go well or that she\'ll even respond. Maybe write her a letter and don\'t send it (or send it...it might be worth the risk). Use the next paragraph to help you decide. Do you know how she feels? How did it end? Did she end it? Was it ended just because of the distance, or are there more differences between you that didn\'t work? Sometimes people are so in love that they can\'t clearly see that the other person isn\'t in love with them anymore. Use the information you have about what she wants for her life...can you honour what she says she needs? If she\'s asked for distance, you would do well to honour that.A key to moving forward: look at your thoughts and where they\'re getting stuck. Write it down. What bad thing can happen if you let it go? Or \"If I move forward, that will mean...\"  Keep going...what would be the worst part of that?  This kind of exploring can help you identify your stuck place.It is possible that you\'ve turned this ending into some kind of negative meaning about you or your future. As in \"If this person doesn\'t love me, then I\'m unlovable\", or \"No one will ever love me as much as she did\". So your need to cling to her in your heart is your way of rejecting that negative message about yourself or the future. Can you find another way to reject that message? Try saying these things to yourself:I know she loved me. There is evidence of that.I was a good partner. There is evidence of that.It\'s part of life to fall in love and then have to move forward...I can do this and learn from it.Many people like me...that\'s how I know I\'m lovable.It\'s normal to feel sad. I\'m grieving a lost love.I want to move forward and not stare in the rearview mirror.I know more love awaits me if I can get fear out of the way.If this person loved me, others can too, (but not if I\'m clinging to some old memory)These are the kinds of things a therapist would explore with you. I wish you well!'),(22,'Q_022','You\'re probably not going to like my answer.Your question says a lot about what YOU want rather than what she wants or what may be best for her. Sometimes, what\'s best for a person is the hardest thing to do, and may be completely opposite of what YOU want.Addictions don\'t happen in a vacuum. If you\'ve had any experience with addicts at all, then I\'m sure you\'ve heard the term \"enabler\". A lot of the times, when people think they\'re \"helping\", they\'re actually enabling the addict to continue their self-destructive behavior. Tough love and clear boundaries are needed in a lot of situations, but especially with addictions. Family and friends are often the biggest contributing factor to someone choosing to use/drink, continuing to do so, or relapsing back into it.You said she recently quit. You said she is depressed. She wants to move. When a person receives counseling for addictions, they are encouraged to make changes like this. They need to break the habit, and this means removing people from their lives at times. It means moving to new locations. Anything that may trigger a relapse needs to be identified and removed. Not only that, but the addict needs to do a lot of personal reflection to figure out WHY they use/drink in the first place, and not only break the physical addiction to it, but deal with whatever is the root cause that led them to use in the first place. She may need some time alone to figure out who she is as a person, time to make some decisions for herself and do what she needs to do to be healthy.Don\'t pressure her to stay. Let her have the freedom to do what she needs to do. If she stays, the decision needs to be hers and hers alone. It doesn\'t need to be made under pressure. That will only lead to resentment. Support her, but don\'t try to change her or make her do anything, especially for selfish reasons. Let her go. It sounds like she needs some time to focus on herself right now. It wouldn\'t be a bad idea for you to do the same.'),(23,'Q_023','Not having support from your family for such a significant problem, is a problem itself.How about your friends, are any of them nurturing or treat you kindly when you bring up that you\'ve got this problem?Are any of your friends willing to accommodate the fact that right now you\'ve got panic attacks from driving and being a passenger?Maybe being and feeling accepted while you\'re in this current phase of your life, would help diminish the panic attacks.If no support is coming to you, then a next step would be to evaluate the relationships in your life and to develop standards and expectations of others, especially that they are considerate of your great need at this time.Its possible you are bearing the emotional burden of a lot more people in your life than yourself.If no one wants to show they care about this situation, then release yourself from trying to please and satisfy everyone\'s wish that you be better, while they ignore your need for their support.Be realistic in what you\'re able to give back to people who want to be blind to your emotional need.Thinking this way will at first raise your anxiety level from fear of losing everyone.  Eventually, you\'ll stabilize within yourself and know that all you\'re asking for is some support for having a tough time. Hopefully, the others will be more responsive to you.If they don\'t you still know that you\'re being reasonable for what you\'d like.'),(24,'Q_024','What kinds of things help you to feel safe?  I think it\'s great you\'ve already tried a few things to help yourself sleep, even if they don\'t work.  Those methods of coping could be targeting something other than paranoia--which is maybe why you aren\'t finding those things are helpful.  If you are really struggling, sometimes meds can help to calm the brain a bit.  If you choose this route, make sure you give your prescribing doctor all the information about your symptoms so your meds can be as accurate as possible for what you\'re dealing with.If you have access, counseling could be beneficial as well.  There are more and more counselors becoming available via telehealth because of COVID, so you could even find someone to help you right in the space you feel most paranoid about (given that space is private).  Either way, talking some of those fears through could at the very least bring some insight, if not some relief.'),(25,'Q_025','It\'s sounds like you are feeling pretty overwhelmed with intrusive thoughts and are feeling very criticized by others as well. I think it is great that you are reaching out and I can tell that you want this to change.

He or she can either look at prescribing you an antidepressant or can refer you to a psychologist or psychiatrist.If that’s not really an option for you, there are also helplines (local or national) or support groups where people dealing with similar issues can talk to each other.

Going to therapy, working with your primary care doctor to check for (and treat) any physical factors, learning healthy coping strategies for your anxiety and depression, increasing your social support, moving your body in ways that feel good, spending time doing something that\'s meaningful to you - all of these can be helpful for treating anxiety and depression!'),(29,'Q_029','Does he tell you a reason as to why he feels you don\'t love him?Ask him this so you will clearly know his definition of \"love\".'),(30,'Q_030','Your question highlights your pain very clearly.  What you are describing is one of the most common scenarios I see in my practice with couples: One partner feels terribly lonely and unimportant in response to the other partner either turning towards other people and activities or being withdrawn and turning inward. My mind immediately goes to a question for you: What happens when you are feeling alone and uncared for? What do you say to yourself about you, about your spouse, and about your relationship?  What do you do in response to these feelings? Do you ask for what you need?  Does this lead to arguments?  Do you stay silent or withdraw?Very often, couples enter into negative patterns where one partner feels afraid of rejection by the other partner and so withdraws from the relationship (and is often seen as \"cold and aloof\" towards the relationship), and the other partner feels afraid of abandonment by the withdrawing partner and so pursues the other (and is often seen as \"critical and nagging\").  Regardless of \"who started it,\" these patterns can turn into infinity loops that take on a gravity of their own, and ultimately cause both partners to withdraw and dissolve the relationship.  If both partners want to work on saving and improving the relationship, the way out of this is to learn about your emotions and patterns together so that you can slow down the pattern and stay in touch with the emotions that pull people together.  As the patterns slow down, partners are better able to get more deeply in touch with their vulnerabilities, needs and longings, and ask for them to be met in such a way that doesn\'t leave the other partner feeling criticized, threatened, abandoned, or uncared for.Some couples can do this without the help of a therapist.  The book \"Hold Me Tight: 7 Conversations for a LIfetime of Love\" by Sue Johnson is a self-help book based on Emotionally Focused Therapy (the most scientifically validated couples therapy that currently exists), and has been helpful to many couples that I see.  When a therapist is needed to help partners reconnect or overcome betrayals, I recommend seeking couples therapists who are trained in a scientifically tested model of couples therapy (such as Emotionally Focused Therapy.  You can learn more about EFT or find an EFT therapist here: http://www.iceeft.com).To summarize:Your pain is understandable and valid.  It\'s telling you what you are missing and what you want.Reconnection comes when we can listen to what our feelings are telling us, express those feelings in a safe way, and assert our wants/needs, while remaining open to the vulnerabilities and needs of our partner.If you can do that on your own, and your relationship is responsive, that\'s fantastic!  If you encounter challenges in resolving this yourself, consider therapy with a trained couples therapist using a model that is scientifically validated.  Pain means this is important!  You and your marriage are worth the effort!'),(31,'Q_031','I want to be short and brief about this. First, If you can achieve a good erection at anytime without your girlfriend, your penis is fine. However, erections work through getting enough blood flow to the penis. If you are having any sort of mental related concern (anxiety, depression, stress, etc) it can cause your blood vessels to constrict and keep your penis from becoming erect. After reading your concerns, my questions would be: What are you thinking about right before and during sex?\" \"Do you feel anxious or nervous during that time?\" Have you ever experienced not getting an erection before?\" I am assuming it has do to with what you are thinking and their is a certain amount of anxiety you are having during or right before sex. If you want to work this out, I would encourage you to work on your thought process and learn to relax your mind and your body (meditation/relaxation exercises). Focus more on enjoying the experience through your 5 senses. What do you smell, take it in and enjoy it. What do you hear, take it in and enjoy it. What do you see, take it in and enjoy it. What do you feel, take it in and enjoy it. Calm yourself! Not having an erection is not the end of the world and happens all the time to men. If you freak out about it, it will happen more.

I also would bet that there are things that your wife would like from you. This is a very common issue; two people with different sexual drives or needs. If you both want the relationship to improve, a couple\'s therapist who works in sexuality is a great idea; it\'s a complex picture that you\'ve only given us a glimpse of.In the meantime, you can try a few things: have compassion for your wife. She\'s in pain and this may preoccupy her. Sex may be uncomfortable for her. She needs understanding. You need understanding too, right?  Help her to see that you\'re not just angry, but lonely and hurt; it might affect how you see yourself as a man. Showing her irritability or anger might push her farther away.There are many ways to be close, intimate, and sexual that don\'t involve intercourse. You might want to explore some of these things and reassure her that you won\'t pressure her to have intercourse. Find out what your wife\'s wishes and ideas are. You might be surprised.These things take time to address, especially if they\'ve been years in the making. I do recommend seeing that therapist. Relationships are very complex and it takes time to explore all the layers and barriers to change. Best of luck.'),(38,'Q_038','That sounds really challenging for both of you. Differences in sexual desire between partners is common and can create real friction and conflict. I would encourage you to do some couples counselling or sex therapy as often these issues can be worked through and low sexual desire can result from relational fears and misunderstandings or sex that isn\'t as arousing as is possible.

It can be scary, frustrating, and lonely. Have you tried talking to him about your concerns? I would suggest to start there. There may be several reasons for his actions, some of which may have nothing to do with how he feels for you. Learning about what is going on for him will likely answer your questions and, depending on his response, may cause some relief. When initiating conversations about subjects that are sensitive, there are a few things that you want to remember. Tell him how you are feeling and what you are experiencing, rather than blaming him or telling him what he is doing wrong. Avoid using extreme, black and white language (i.e. always and never). For example, you may say something such as, \"I feel confused that we are rarely intimate and I\'m wondering if you\'ve also noticed this change\" versus \"You are never intimate with me anymore.\" Don\'t be afraid to ask him questions. You deserve to know what is going on, as his behavior is effecting your well being. I like to ask open-ended questions instead of yes and no questions. It allows for more clarity and deeper explanation. Lastly, ask yourself (and possibly him) what part you play in the recent changes. Does he feel that you\'ve been distant? Does he need something from you? Let him know that you are willing to work things out as a team. If communication attempts fail, seeing a couple\'s therapist can be a great benefit. Having an objective party to coach you through this difficut time can give you the support that will create lasting changes in your relationship.Best of luck to you!'),(40,'Q_040','Hi Michigan,This is a common issue.

You can be stronger in the scarred places. I would suggest that you each have a separate job to do to rebuild this trust. It is definitely possible to rebuild it, because anything is possible if both people want it enough.Your boyfriend came clean to you...this is pretty crucial. He chose to honour your needs rather than keep the secret. You can use that as evidence in your \"proof that he loves me\" file. Work on that file...thicken it up. Having a thick \"he does care about me and wouldn\'t hurt me again\" file will help you. Other things that he can do to help you thicken that file (because after all, his behaviours caused this problem): answer all your questions, don\'t brush you off if you\'re feeling insecure, treat you as though you\'re a priority, avoid questionable contact with other women, have open communication, give you passwords to devices so there is transparency. He can help you to understand where those behaviours came from...why he cheated in the first places (although people aren\'t always good with those \'why\' questions!)You can focus on telling yourself that people change, that he deserves a chance to show you he can be loyal (or at least you\'ve decided to give him that chance), and that you want to be a trusting person. If you act like a trusting person, you will likely feel more like one. Don\'t go snooping, don\'t interrogate him. It\'s normal you might feel scared and try to tell him that when you do.

You would really enjoy some sexual activities that your wife hasn\'t initiated in a long while, but it\'s a big leap to go from that to \"I married the wrong person\". Fear is telling you that she doesn\'t respect or like or want you? Look at the bigger picture. What is the evidence that your wife wants to please you?...that she is the \"right\" woman for you?...that she loves you?...that she cares about what\'s important to you?  If there is evidence there, then you owe it to the marriage to rein in your fearful thoughts.Talking to your wife is so important right now.

Almost everyone has the same fears you do, to some degree, especially if they lack experience. Men also feel far more of these fears than you realize.

Having a partner you can trust with your fears and who you feel safe with is so important. When you\'re really confident someone cares deeply for you, this can help the fears to go away or diminish. How well do you know your own body? Getting to know how you like to be touched and how different touches feel...getting acquainted with your body yourself first...this can help build sexual confidence. In general, our partners care less about our fat and wrinkles than they care about how we make them feel in bed.

In the future, it is probably best to leave details out of conversations like this. I think it is common and natural for partners to ask about the sexual history. For one thing, it is a good idea to be checked for STD’s before entering into a sexual relationship with someone, and it is fair to share that information with each other. Partners usually want to know how many you have been with and what kind of sexual preferences you have or if there is anything you don’t like to do. This gets into a gray area for some people. I don’t necessarily want to know how many people my partner has been with and I certainly don’t want a whole lot of details. Sometimes that is an image I just don’t want in my head about my partner. Vague details are usually enough.However, I understand that your partner has the details and is not happy with your past. This is a reflection on him, not you. This shows insecurities on his part. You cannot control how he will react to information that you provide to him and you cannot control how he feels about the information. The past should remain in the past and not be held against you in the present or future. If he cannot handle your past then it is going to cloud your relationship. You can offer couples counseling to him and see if he will go with you. I have seen relationships recover from some very serious problems such as infidelity. It takes two people who both want it to work to make it work though. If your boyfriend cannot get over your past, you may have to let him go. Don’t keep yourself tied to someone who is not right for you. Constantly holding your past over your head and holding that against you is only going to bring you down and eventually you may start having insecurities or low self-esteem due to this type of treatment. I don’t see that you have done anything wrong. If you aren’t cheating on him now and you answered his questions about your past honestly, how he handles that information is on him. Ultimately, relationships have a tendency to come and go. Don’t fight to hold onto someone who is not right for you. It is okay to be single and enjoy being the best you that you can be.

You know, I meet with a lot of people who are so sick of the crap that their ex puts them through in the divorce process that yes, they wonder if it\'s best to go back. I don\'t think so.If your ex is using the children to manipulate, or is generally controlling the separation process, that\'s confirmation that getting out was the right decision.Your partner feels powerless to change the current situation. Of course he does, because there are many things that are beyond his control (his ex\'s behaviours, for one). Accept the powerlessness. Lean into it. It\'s okay, because there are many things he does have power over, and that\'s where he can focus. He has the power to give his children a happy dad. That\'s HUGE. That\'s why he left, I\'d guess. I bet the main barrier to him being happy is the guilt he feels. That\'s his ex\'s voice...that\'s what she wants him to feel...to give into that is letting her win. Ending a marriage in order to be happy is his right. He has not intentionally harmed his children. Hopefully he\'s aware that the separation has  affected them and he\'s working to create peace and balance in their lives, but he\'s can let go of the shame she wants him to feel; it\'s crippling him.He has the power to separate emotionally from his ex. He\'s not doing that when he lets her words control his emotions. He\'s still reacting to her.

It is also common to want to be very closely connected to people who are important to you.It may be helpful to have a conversation about talking more or talking about how you feel when he is not there and how he feels about answering you right away. It may be helpful for both of you to listen to each other and what you are feeling and experiencing so that you can look at what may work for both of you. For example, maybe you could remind yourself that he will answer you when he is not busy or as soon as he can.Sometimes just talking about these feelings can be helpful so that you can both have open discussions about whether the amount or type of communication is too much or in a style that is not working for both of you. You could also consider leaving text messages or something that does not require an immediate response so that when he is busy, you have the ability to write a message, and he has the ability to answer when he can.I also wonder where you are getting the idea that something bad happened. I don\'t know whether something happen with this person in the past or perhaps at another time in your life.Some people benefit from ideas such as not going to bed angry, but this is difficult for others.I would suggest considering what makes each of you feel loved, valued, appreciated, or special.Also think about what styles of communication you both like and what is and is not okay in the context of an argument.It may be difficult to talk about what has related to him being distant and it may be helpful to talk about ways to communicate about this first (such as taking a 10 minute timeout if it becomes overwhelming).Perhaps talking with a therapist who specializes in couples would be helpful if talking about this between you is confusing or if you do not both feel heard by the other person.

How he responds to your question will give you an idea whether he helps you to feel more emotionally secure and builds trust or if you feel that you cannot be open with him.

Some of your words tell me that you think you know what he\'s thinking (that he wants to fight so he can leave, that he thinks he\'s perfect). It\'s always tricky when we assume what someone\'s thinking, and in an argument or dialogue, these kinds of statements tend to lead to defensiveness and an escalated argument. I\'d encourage you to focus on his actual behaviours and how they affect you, rather than the motives or beliefs you think are behind the behaviours (because you really can\'t know what he\'s thinking unless he tells you). As a general rule, the \"When you do X, I feel Y\" sentence goes far in helping others understand what we feel.So, it\'s fair to say \"when you lie to me, I can\'t trust you\", or \"when you end our date early to hang with your friends I feel like I\'m not important to you\", or \"your mood swings are difficult for me\", or \"I don\'t seem to get apologies from you\". Try to focus on his actual behaviour when you talk to him about this stuff. A relationship counsellor can help you each understand the other better beyond the surface behaviours if you want to improve the relationship.That said, I have to ask...if you haven\'t been with Mr. Not So Great for very long, is it maybe time to rethink the relationship? Unless there is a balance of really loving and positive behaviours that you\'re leaving out, you don\'t seem happy. A good therapist can help you understand why you are stuck in an unhappy relationship, if that is what\'s happening. There\'s a lot to sort out here...how to communicate about your needs, how to know when to call it quits if something doesn\'t feel good...

This fear is helpful to some extent, because it will assist you in taking care of yourself and not taking unnecessary risks with your health.

You can work to put it into perspective.I invite you to imagine that your job is to convince fear that you don\'t need it screaming in your ear constantly in order to be as safe as you can be. Imagine that fear is in front of you. It\'s saying \"hey, you need me! If I wasn\'t keeping you alert, you would be very ill\". Fear doesn\'t trust you to take care of yourself. What is the evidence you are caring for yourself and doing everything you can to prevent a recurrence? What is the evidence that this won\'t likely happen again (it was specifically connected to the stress of labour, right?). What is the evidence from your doctor that this is unlikely to recur? What is the evidence that you are healing? What is the evidence that you are very aware of the danger and will respond quickly if there is a recurrence? What is the evidence that worrying about it will hurt you, not help you?

You may be right, your physical symptoms of getting sick to your stomach may very well be your nerves or anxiety. That is totally normal and understandable given your circumstances. Another thing that is not unusual is that you feel better when you sit and rock. That is actually a fairly common way that many people comfort themselves in times of high stress. If you are concerned that there is an actual physical illness causing these symptoms, you may want to visit your primary care provider. They may tell you that they don\'t see anything physically wrong with you, and at that point you may want to visit a counselor about the symptoms and your relationship experience. A visit with a counselor may be a good idea either way. I work as a counselor in primary care, and I promise you that many people have very real physical symptoms when they have gone through abuse. Unexplainable stomach and headaches are very common. Sometimes, with counseling, those physical symptoms actually stop. Be well, and I hope you feel better soon.Robin J.

This would need to be assessed first since if it has been ongoing, it may be making the situation worse and given the time it has been utilized as a coping mechanism, there is reason to believe that the structure of your brain may have been effected as has been demonstrated by current neurological research.  There are however, ways to address this.  As for coping mechanisms, the person you work with should also look at offering you alternatives such as the skills found within the Dialectic Behavior Therapy model (DBT) which has several useful tools to help address the underlying anxiety and difficulty managing emotional regulation.  Mindfulness, another component of DBT should also prove to be useful in both becoming aware of your state of mind and emotional state to allow you to make different choices which has been supported by a growing body of evidence.  There are also other tools designed to help repair damaged relationships.  Well worth looking into.Seeking help is never easy and it is only human to be hesitant given some of the cultural views of working with therapist.  This is a difficult place to be in and one that is not easy to move out of, but sitting on it is not going to help it go away.  Think of it this way, if you broke your arm, would you just wrap it up and hope for the best? or seek out a professional to help you set the break and teach you how to mend the wound.  The same applies here.  Think of it as first aid for the mind.'),(83,'Q_083','I\'m sorry you\'re going through that.  Panic attacks are terrifying.One thing to start with is knowing that panic attacks are not going to hurt you and your anxiety will come down with time.  Fighting that process can sometimes heighten symptoms because your brain wants the message of panic to be heard.  Some of the best ways to counter that message is through focusing on the present moment through sensations or breathing.  Taking deep breaths allows your body and brain to slow down, sending the message that there\'s no present danger.  Focusing on the present can also send the same message, as anxiety typically throws us into the \"what ifs\" of the future.  If you search google or pinterest, there are tons of methods you can use for this---some people prefer to focus on colors, shapes, smells, textures, etc., while other prefer to pay attention to internal sensations.  There are also apps that can help with these techniques, such as Calm and Headspace.  They work best when you aren\'t in a panic attack or when you feel one coming on.  If you are already at the peak of an attack, they can still help, it just may take a bit longer.  Some clients I have like to track their anxiety with a scale system.  Let\'s say you scale your anxiety at an 8 out of 10, do some breathing exercises for 5 minutes, then scale it again.  It\'s likely the anxiety decreased, at least to a 7 or 7.5.  Doing this can give you some physical proof that you have some control over your body.  You can also scale it without the breathing to see how it just fluctuates on its own.  Anxiety will always go down and you can see that happening via numbers.  This method will let you see the light at the end of the tunnel.There are other ways that might work for you via a quick google search, or through therapy.  Keep trying new things until you find what works best for you!'),(84,'Q_084','Overwhelming fear, social anxiety and depression are especially painful because they make behaving constructively a challenge.  But there are also lots of examples of folks who have successfully worked their way through this.  So there is hope!   In addition to the suggestion to visit your doctor (who may prescribe a medication to help you relax), there are many social service agencies who provide free counseling or take medicaid.  A good CBT therapist will help you look at your thinking so that you may see how you are distorting your thoughts.  Behavior is also important.  Despite how you may feel: it is helpful to go out, to do things that relax you (maybe a yoga class or a meditation class?).  Exercise.

This is one of those times when you wish you could assure someone that everything will go perfectly, but unfortunately I can\'t do that. There is no way of knowing how parents might respond until you tell them. The truth is that people have come out to their parents in many different ways. Some have told their parents directly, some drop hints, some have had others tell their parents, etc. The only \"right\" way to come out is the one that you choose. The one that feels right to you. That is the best way. Some people decide not to come out, and some wait for a very long time. Both of these things are okay. Coming out is deeply personal, and there can be real consequences to someone\'s emotional health and safety if they tell the wrong person. That is why it should only be done when you are ready. When you feel that you have the emotional and personal support that you need to take the risk. Sometimes people can feel pressured to come out, but I encourage you to do it in your own time. The truth is, there is a spectrum of how people\'s parents react to this kind of news. On one end, you may have the parents who shut a person out and are abusive, and on the opposite side you may have parents that are totally okay with it and throw you a \"Coming Out\" party. Most parents are going to fall somewhere in the middle. It is important to remember that their feelings may change over time. Many parents struggle at first, but they love their kids and get better with it over time. If you decide to tell them, consider taking someone along to support you. Plan ahead on what you want to say. It can be an emotional time, so do what you need to do to take care of yourself. If you need to, leave. You don\'t have to stay anywhere where someone is being cruel to you. I wish you well, and good luck.Robin J.

We cannot change what others do but we can change how what they do affects us.

The other is a household where things were chaotic and you never knew what was going to happen next and had no stability.

Guilt is one of those things that nearly everyone has experienced at one time or another, and it can feel like a huge weight around your neck. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that we can give you some words of wisdom that will make it all go away. However, I will give you some ideas and hopefully this will help.One of the things that we know about guilt is that it doesn\'t usually do much to help us in the long-run. People may make changes for a short-term period of time because they feel guilty about something they did, but usually they will go back to their old behaviors if they don\'t have something else to help them change permanently, such as a new skill. So, guilt doesn\'t necessarily help us. In fact, as I write this someone out there is eating an entire key lime pie because they feel guilty about falling off their diet. Someone may be drinking alcohol because they feel guilty about drinking alcohol. For whatever reason, this is just a common thing that we do. Now accountability is different than guilt. Accountability can actually be constructive.  When you hold yourself accountable you can admit that you have done something wrong. That it hurt others and you deeply regret it. That you are prepared to take steps to make sure it doesn\'t happen again. That you have done what you can to make amends, if necessary. That you are sorry. And then you move on. Why is moving on necessary? Well, for one thing, it doesn\'t usually help the people who you hurt. In fact, someone\'s guilty behavior may serve to remind the people who were hurt, over and over again, about what happened. Guilt is usually 100% about us, and not about those we hurt. Also, guilt can lead us to behave in ways that may even hurt people more. Having said all of that, guilt is a normal human emotion. Sometimes we experience it for a while and it goes away. Sometimes we need help to work through it. There are many self-help books about forgiving yourself. You can try Amazon to find some, or consider getting help from a counselor.

Boy, ending relationships is tough, isn\'t it? Sometimes it\'s tough even when we are 100% sure that it is the right thing to do!I am going to give you some of my thoughts, and hopefully some colleagues will add some others. One of the things that I want to point out is that \"letting go\" is not really a thing. In other words, it\'s not really something you can reach out and grab. It\'s more of a process. This is good news, because you don\'t necessarily have to be at the end of the process to end an unhealthy relationship. We just have to accept that there will be feelings that come up even after the relationship is over. For example, someone can end an unhealthy relationship today, but then be reminded of the good times on what would have been their \"anniversary.\" This could make the person very sad. They may even regret ending the relationship for a little while. It would important, then, for the person to remind themselves why the relationship needed to end, and that they are healthier because of it. This is relevant for you. It\'s hard to walk away from a relationship. We fear all kinds of things, including being single! Sometimes it\'s helpful to compare what you are getting out of the relationship to what you want from a relationship. It\'s helpful to be honest about what we have given up for an unhealthy relationship. It\'s fine to admit uncertainly about ending things. It\'s okay to be afraid. It\'s okay to have moments of doubt and sadness along with a dash of guilt. And even with all of that, someone can still leave if it is the healthiest thing for them. They can have sadness later on, and still not go back.It sounds like you are feeling responsible for making sure he is okay because of this divorce. The truth is that there is not necessarily a \"perfect\" time to end any relationship. There would be no guarantee that he would be doing any better after the divorce.

Changing unwanted behavior is one of the hardest things a person can do. I agree with Sherry that being patient with yourself is important. Here are a few things I would suggest:1. Get clear on the behaviors you really want to change, and make sure they are behaviors that CAN be changed. Sometimes we will set a goal like, \"I want to be more confident\" but that is hard to measure and prove to yourself that you accomplished it. Saying you are going to accept a date or go on a job interview is something you can actually do, and something that you may consider to be demonstrating confidence. Whatever your change of behavior is, make sure it is something you can actually change. 2. If you are going to give up a behavior, decide what you are going to do in place of it. So, if you are going to stop showing up late for work, then you are deciding to be on time for work and demonstrating your value of being punctual. 3. If you are going to make changes, really nail down WHY you want to make them. What is it about making these changes that is important to you as a person? For example, if you have the goal of weight loss, the reason this is important to you as a person may be because you value self-care. Knowing WHY you want to make changes is both your motivation and your compass for getting there. 4. Once you know WHY you want to make these changes, I strongly suggest setting small goals.

It doesn\'t feel good to be angry all the time, and it\'s stealing your energy as well as affecting relationships, I\'m sure.Working with a therapist, you can learn to recognise the deep emotions that lie underneath the anger. It\'s likely to be either powerlessness or worthlessness, and what happens is this... a small moment in the present touches on an old, tender, bruised emotion that we\'ve simply felt too much of or too strongly in the past. We develop ways of avoiding these vulnerable emotions, and anger is one way of doing that. So, when someone looks at you in a certain way, or says something, you\'d rather be angry than feel powerless, or unimportant (or whatever your kryptonite feeling is). In that moment, your instinct is to blame whatever happened, no matter how small, because that\'s the thing that happened just before you got mad. You fail to recognise that the problem is not the look on that person\'s face, or the shoe that someone left in front of the door...it\'s that you can\'t stand feeling something and you want to avoid it like you want to stamp your foot out if it\'s on fire.I suggest finding a therapist to work with.

I understand that working with a therapist sounds risky, given your experiences, and at the same time a good therapist may be a beneficial resource in helping you deal with the intrusive thoughts, cope with and alleviate the stress that they create, and perhaps even lead to the alleviation of the thoughts themselves. A therapist may also be able to help you discover strategies to work towards any goals you have around reconnecting with your children and working again. If therapy feels too unsafe at the moment, I would recommend looking into workbooks on how to deal with intrusive thoughts and coping with stress.

I agree with the other poster who recommended you try and ask him more questions with an open and curious attitude and see if he might be open to explaining more with you. That being said, what we also know from research is that frequently what turns us on isn\'t always what we identify as.  Lots of people have fantasies or even sexual behaviors they may enjoy from time to time without considering themselves to be a part of any label or subculture. For example, many women are okay with having their hair pulled or bottom spanked during a particular rowdy sexual encounter but certainly don\'t consider themselves kinky, submissive, or anything else.  It could be that your husband enjoys pretending/ fantasizing that he is something completely different in the bedroom from time to time from what most other see him as outside in the corporate world or in other roles he plays as husband, father, son, friend etc.  Many of my kink clients are drawn to their particular fetish simply because it\'s the opposite of what their life typically entails (e.g., a high profile CEO who is always responsible for making the decisions enjoys being at \"the mercy\" of someone else once a week). Each of us has a sexual script - a blueprint if you will of what we like and don\'t like in the bedroom and also what we have each come to see as being \"normal.\"  It\'s also an internal guideline for how we each define our role in sexual expression, sexual orientation, sexual behaviors, sexual desires, and how big a part our sexual identity plays in our everyday lives (Gagnon & Simon, 1973).You\'ve been clued into the fact that your husbands greatly differs from yours on the surface level at the moment. ALL of us are sexual beings yet none of us is exactly identical to one another in our sexual definitions and script expectations. It\'s like our own sex fingerprint. In my role as a couples counselor, I often help partners become aware of their own sexual script and explore where it overlaps their partners and where it may always differ.  If a couple is able to successfully navigate formulating a plan for both to feel validated and sexually satisfied, the relationship thrives. Most counselors would agree that a healthy script includes:Both partners taking ownership for the couple\'s sexual experiences.Both partners learning to communicate openly and honestly about their feelings.Both partners learning to meet one another\'s - needs, desires, and wishes while making sure his/her own needs are being met.If \"pegging\" your husband as it\'s called is a hard and fast no for you, that will likely need to be respected as it may be too far off your own sexual script.  However, if your husband is for sure absolutely adamant about \"needing\" to dress in a female fashion and/or be anally penetrated, you may seek professional counseling to help navigate how both of you will come to an agreement about fulfilling these desires in a way that doesn\'t hurt either one of you or the marriage.My warmest wishes to you both!'),(151,'Q_151','It can absolutely be normal for men to fantasize about sexual activities with other men!

Don’t loan him the car keys or pay any household bills for him. Don’t call in sick to work for him or make excuses for him in any way. Do not bail him out of jail when he gets arrested. He needs to be responsible for himself. This may mean losing his job or losing his driver’s license. This may mean that he loses his family if he doesn’t stop. What you and your family can do is set boundaries about what you will put up with.

That\'s because addiction is a disease - just like diabetes or high blood pressure. Imagine I gave a huge piece of chocolate cake to a diabetic. After he eats the cake, I say to him \"Use your willpower to lower your glucose to 100.\" Do you think he would be successful? All addictions are behaviors. Behavior can be understood in terms of function and reinforcement. All behavior is either an attempt to get something or an attempt to get away from something. If you apply this logic to addictive behaviors, the use of mood-altering substances is an attempt to create a particular feeling or emotion, or an attempt to numb one. When a behavior is reinforced, we are more likely to engage in the same behavior again in the future. Let\'s assume that I\'m feeling very anxious. I drink some alcohol and notice that my anxiety decreases. My brain takes note of this and the next time I\'m feeling anxious I am more likely to reach for a bottle. Now, imagine this happening hundreds, if not thousands, of times.  Addiction recovery is about identifying and treating the underlying reasons for the use. A qualified addiction therapist will assist you in developing a relapse prevention plan that addresses these underlying issues and helps you to identify triggers for your use. Additionally, you will learn how to avoid triggers and gain healthy coping skills to use instead of relying on alcohol. I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors. Recovery can be difficult and requires a willingness to change just about everything in your life. But the rewards are tremendous!'),(174,'Q_174','Maybe it is a way to secretly satisfy your own wish to be or to live life gay.'),(175,'Q_175','Different Licensed Professionals are trained to use different types of tests and interviews to identify symptoms and draw a diagnosis.  In Counseling we use an interview evaluation that considers person\'s physical and mental health, plus their social and economical environment in combination with Psychological testing.  The evaluation process usually takes the first two sessions, depending on how many persons are interviewed and what type of assessments are provided. ¿Cómo se diagnostica a una persona?Diferentes Profesionales Licenciados están entrenados para usar diferentes tipos de exámenes y entrevistas para identificar síntomas y diagnosis.   En el área de consejería utilizamos un proceso de entrevista que considera la salud física y mental de una persona,  su ambiente socio económico, en combinación con exámenes psicológicos.  El proceso de evaluación normalmente toma las primeras dos sesiones, dependiendo de cuantas personas sean entrevistadas y de qué tipo de evaluación se utilice.'),(176,'Q_176','How can we handle stress in healthy ways?\nEat and drink to optimize your health.

If it is related to your family and often relationship with family members could affect our self-esteem and self-worth, then perhaps it is worthwhile exploring what you find unhappy about your relationship with your family.

The time right after people leave the hospital after receiving psychiatric services is a time of high risk for suicide. It is very important, after hospitalization,Â to getÂ follow-up care with a professional as soon as possible. If your husband has an established therapist, this is the time to call. It is also a good time to alert your support system of friends, family, clergy or others to let them know he is still struggling. This is good support for him AND you.It is important to think about means and opportunity to make another attempt. Means really do matter.Â  So, if you have a firearm in the home, it is really important to remove it. You can\'t remove all things that a person may hurt themselves with, but some things are more lethal than others. Firearms are very lethal. I am not sure what means he used last time, but try to reduce the opportunity for him to access it again. This is where your support system can help out. People can take turns hanging out with him until you are sure the crisis is over.If you believe that an attempt is going to occur, talk to your husband about going back to the hospital. If he refuses, you will want to find out what your options are to have him go even if he doesn\'t want to. I know the thought of that really hurts, but it can save his life. Calling 9-1-1 is alwaysÂ aÂ good option if you are not sure. Usually a suicide crisis, meaning they want to harm themselves right now, lasts a few minutes, hours or days. Sometimes when you get them through the crisis stage, they no longer want to commit suicide. But, as you are indicating, that feeling of wanting to commit suicide can come back again. So, it is always good to have a plan. If you want more information, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. They will always answer: 1-800-273-8255. They can help you create a specific safety plan. I do hope things work out alright. Be well. Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPCC, NCC'),('Q_012','M2',' Thanks for reaching out.

The fact that you were planning marriage and a future tells me that you meant something very special to each other at that time. It\'s different now...you\'re not together anymore, but you can\'t accept this, right? Good for you for identifying that this situation is damaging your life. You\'ve been grieving for longer than you were together. Oh, but really you\'ve not been grieving...you\'re stuck still loving her instead of moving forward. Unrequited love is a recipe for eternal heartache. Let\'s look at some possible blocks to moving forward.It could be that there\'s something unfinished for you. Maybe you felt hurt and you didn\'t have the chance to say so, or you felt you hurt her and you didn\'t have the chance to make it right. Maybe there\'s a burning question you need to ask or something else you need to say. Maybe you want to tell her you\'ve never stopped loving her, and see if she feels the same way. If this is the case, you have two choices, right? You can reach out and say what you need to say, or you can stop ruminating on that question and let it go. If you reach out, there\'s no guarantee it will go well or that she\'ll even respond. Maybe write her a letter and don\'t send it (or send it...it might be worth the risk). Use the next paragraph to help you decide.Â Do you know how she feels? How did it end? Did she end it? Was it ended just because of the distance, or are there more differences between you that didn\'t work? Sometimes people are so in love that they can\'t clearly see that the other person isn\'t in love with them anymore. Use the information you have about what she wants for her life...can you honour what she says she needs? If she\'s asked for distance, you would do well to honour that.A key to moving forward: look at your thoughts and where they\'re getting stuck. Write it down. What bad thing can happen if you let it go? Or \"If I move forward, that will mean...\" Â Keep going...what would be the worst part of that? Â This kind of exploring can help you identify your stuck place.It is possible that you\'ve turned this ending into some kind of negative meaning about you or your future. As in \"If this person doesn\'t love me, then I\'m unlovable\", or \"No one will ever love me as much as she did\". So your need to cling to her in your heart is your way of rejecting that negative message about yourself or the future. Can you find another way to reject that message? Try saying these things to yourself:I know she loved me. There is evidence of that.I was a good partner. There is evidence of that.It\'s part of life to fall in love and then have to move forward...I can do this and learn from it.Many people like me...that\'s how I know I\'m lovable.It\'s normal to feel sad. I\'m grieving a lost love.I want to move forward and not stare in the rearview mirror.I know more love awaits me if I can get fear out of the way.If this person loved me, others can too, (but not if I\'m clinging to some old memory)These are the kinds of things a therapist would explore with you.

If you\'ve had any experience with addicts at all, then I\'m sure you\'ve heard the term \"enabler\".

She wants to move. When a person receives counseling for addictions, they are encouraged to make changes like this. They need to break the habit, and this means removing people from their lives at times. It means moving to new locations. Anything that may trigger a relapse needs to be identified and removed. Not only that, but the addict needs to do a lot of personal reflection to figure out WHY they use/drink in the first place, and not only break the physical addiction to it, but deal with whatever is the root cause that led them to use in the first place. She may need some time alone to figure out who she is as a person, time to make some decisions for herself and do what she needs to do to be healthy.Don\'t pressure her to stay.

What do you say to yourself about you, about your spouse, and about your relationship?Â  What do you do in response to these feelings? Do you ask for what you need?Â  Does this lead to arguments?Â  Do you stay silent or withdraw?Very often, couples enter into negative patterns where one partner feels afraid of rejection by the other partner and so withdraws from the relationship (and is often seen as \"cold and aloof\" towards the relationship), and the other partner feels afraid of abandonment by the withdrawing partner and so pursues the other (and is often seen as \"critical and nagging\").Â  Regardless of \"who started it,\" these patterns canÂ turn into infinity loops that take on a gravity of their own, and ultimately cause both partners to withdraw and dissolve the relationship.Â  If both partners want to work on saving and improving the relationship, the way out of this is to learn about your emotions and patterns together so that you can slow down the pattern and stay in touch with the emotions that pull people together.Â  As the patternsÂ slow down, partners are better able to get more deeply in touch with their vulnerabilities, needs and longings, and ask for them to be met in such a way that doesn\'t leave the other partner feeling criticized, threatened, abandoned, or uncared for.Some couples can do this without the help of a therapist.Â  The book \"Hold Me Tight: 7 Conversations for a LIfetime of Love\" by Sue Johnson is a self-help book based on Emotionally Focused Therapy (the most scientifically validated couples therapy that currently exists), and has been helpful to many couples that I see.Â  When a therapist is needed to help partners reconnect or overcome betrayals, I recommend seeking couples therapists who are trained in a scientifically tested model of couples therapy (such as Emotionally Focused Therapy.Â  You can learn more about EFT or find an EFT therapist here: http://www.iceeft.com).To summarize:Your pain is understandable and valid.Â  It\'s telling you what you are missing and what you want.Reconnection comes when we can listen to what our feelings are telling us, express those feelings in a safe way, and assert our wants/needs,Â while remaining open to the vulnerabilities and needs of our partner.If you can do that on your own, and your relationship is responsive, that\'s fantastic!Â  If you encounter challenges in resolving this yourself, consider therapy with a trained couples therapist using a model that is scientifically validated.Â  Pain means this is important!Â  You and your marriage are worth the effort!'),('Q_030','M2',' I am sorry to hear this.

It can be scary, frustrating, and lonely. Have you tried talking to him about your concerns? I would suggest to start there. There may be several reasons for his actions, some of which may have nothing to do with how he feels for you.Â Learning about what is going on for him will likely answer your questions and, depending on his response, mayÂ cause some relief. WhenÂ initiating conversations about subjects that are sensitive, there are a few things that you want to remember.Â Tell him how you are feeling and what you are experiencing, rather than blaming him or telling him what he is doing wrong. AvoidÂ using extreme, black and white language (i.e. always and never).Â For example, you may say something such as, \"I feel confused that we are rarely intimate and I\'m wondering if you\'ve also noticed this change\" versus \"You are never intimate with me anymore.\"Â Don\'t be afraid to ask him questions. You deserve to know what is going on, as his behavior is effecting your well being. I like to ask open-ended questions instead of yes and no questions. It allows forÂ more clarity and deeperÂ explanation. Lastly,Â ask yourself (and possibly him) what part you play in the recent changes. Does he feel that you\'ve been distant? Does he need something from you? Let him know that you are willing to work things out as a team. If communication attempts fail, seeing a couple\'s therapist can be a great benefit.

In the future, it is probably best to leave details out of conversations like this. I think it is common and natural for partners to ask about the sexual history. For one thing, it is a good idea to be checked for STDâ€™s before entering into a sexual relationship with someone, and it is fair to share that information with each other. Partners usually want to know how many you have been with and what kind of sexual preferences you have or if there is anything you donâ€™t like to do. This gets into a gray area for some people. I donâ€™t necessarily want to know how many people my partner has been with and I certainly donâ€™t want a whole lot of details. Sometimes that is an image I just donâ€™t want in my head about my partner. Vague details are usually enough.However, I understand that your partner has the details and is not happy with your past. This is a reflection on him, not you. This shows insecurities on his part. You cannot control how he will react to information that you provide to him and you cannot control how he feels about the information. The past should remain in the past and not be held against you in the present or future. If he cannot handle your past then it is going to cloud your relationship. You can offer couples counseling to him and see if he will go with you. I have seen relationships recover from some very serious problems such as infidelity. It takes two people who both want it to work to make it work though.Â If your boyfriend cannot get over your past, you may have to let him go. Donâ€™t keep yourself tied to someone who is not right for you. Constantly holding your past over your head and holding that against you is only going to bring you down and eventually you may start having insecurities or low self-esteem due to this type of treatment. I donâ€™t see that you have done anything wrong. If you arenâ€™t cheating on him now and you answered his questions about your past honestly, how he handles that information is on him.

These questions help couples to build connection and trust. It\'s based on the idea that if you reach out to him for whatever reason (support, openess, understanding, empathy), you can count on him and can expect him to be responsive. How he responds to your question will give you an idea whether he helps you to feel more emotionally secure and builds trust or if you feel that you cannot be open with him. If your partner responds in an open and understanding manner, it usually indicates that he cares about your feelings and values your importance. If he responds in a defensive manner, it could mean that he does not like that you are questioning your trust in him or that he has something to hide.

I live in the other Ontario; in Canada. I\'ll try to help you sort this out. You have a long list of complaints about your boyfriend!Â It sounds like he\'s maybe a bit immature and moody, and these things affect you, for sure. I get it.Â It\'sÂ got me curious, and if I was working with you, I\'d want to know a lot more about how long you\'ve been together andÂ what\'s actually working well between you two. I would also ask a lot of questions about the details of your description. What tells you he\'s \'sneaky\'? Does he lie? How do you know he lies to you? Also, are you wanting to make things better with him, do you just want an ear to vent to, are you looking for validation, or do you hope someone will help you wake up to an unhappy situation? Â It helps me if I know what you want.Whenever I meet someone who has a lot of complaints about their partner or boyfriend, I encourage them first to look at the language they\'re using. Some of your words tell me that you think you know what he\'s thinking (that he wants to fight so he can leave, that he thinks he\'s perfect). It\'s always tricky when we assume what someone\'s thinking, and in an argument or dialogue, these kinds of statements tend to lead to defensiveness and an escalated argument. I\'d encourage you to focus on his actual behaviours and how they affect you, rather than the motives or beliefs you think are behind the behaviours (because you really can\'t know what he\'s thinking unless he tells you). As a general rule, the \"When you do X, I feel Y\" sentence goes far in helping others understand what we feel.So, it\'s fair to say \"when you lie to me, I can\'t trust you\", or \"when you end our date early to hang with your friends I feel like I\'m not important to you\", or \"your mood swings are difficult for me\", or \"I don\'t seem to get apologies from you\". Try to focus on his actual behaviour when you talk to him about this stuff. A relationship counsellor can help you each understand the other better beyond the surface behaviours if you want to improve the relationship.That said, I have to ask...if you haven\'t been with Mr. Not So Great for very long, is it maybe time to rethink the relationship? Unless there is a balance of really loving and positive behaviours that you\'re leaving out, you don\'t seem happy. A good therapist can help you understand why you are stuck in an unhappy relationship, if that is what\'s happening.Â There\'s a lot to sort out here...how to communicate about your needs, how to know when to call it quits if something doesn\'t feel good...

You can work to put it into perspective.I invite you to imagine that your job is to convince fear that you don\'t need it screaming in your ear constantly in order to be as safe as you can be. Imagine that fear is in front of you. It\'s saying \"hey, you need me! If I wasn\'t keeping you alert, you would be very ill\".

What is the evidence that this won\'t likely happen again (it was specifically connected to the stress of labour, right?). What is the evidence from your doctor that this is unlikely to recur? What is the evidence that you are healing? What is the evidence that you are very aware of the danger and will respond quickly if there is a recurrence? What is the evidence that worrying about it will hurt you, not help you?

Developing unhealthy ways of coping with life is only going to make life more difficult for you.I donâ€™t know if this is what it is like for you at your house, but there are two kinds of household environments that can cause dysfunction in children.

The other is a household where things were chaotic and you never knew what was going to happen next and had no stability.

Guilt is one of those things that nearly everyone has experienced at one time or another, and it can feel like a huge weight around your neck. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that we can give you some words of wisdom that will make it all go away. However, I will give you some ideas and hopefully this will help.One of the things that we know about guilt is that it doesn\'t usually do much to help us in the long-run. People may make changes for a short-term period of time because they feel guilty about something they did, but usually they will go back to their old behaviors if they don\'t have something else to help them change permanently, such as a new skill. So, guilt doesn\'t necessarily help us. In fact, as I write this someone out there is eating an entire key lime pie because they feel guilty about falling off their diet. Someone may be drinking alcohol because they feel guilty about drinking alcohol. For whatever reason, this is just a common thing that we do. Now accountability is different than guilt. Accountability can actually be constructive.Â  When you hold yourself accountable you can admit that you have done something wrong. That it hurt others and you deeply regret it. That you are prepared to take steps to make sure it doesn\'t happen again.Â ThatÂ youÂ have done what you can to make amends, if necessary. That you are sorry. And then you move on. Why is moving on necessary? Well, for one thing, it doesn\'tÂ usuallyÂ help the people who you hurt. In fact, someone\'s guilty behavior may serve to remind the people who were hurt, over and over again, about what happened. Guilt is usually 100% about us, and not about those we hurt. Also, guilt can lead us to behave in ways that may even hurt people more. Having said all of that, guilt is a normal human emotion. Sometimes we experience it for a while and it goes away. Sometimes we need help to work through it. There are many self-help books about forgiving yourself. You can try Amazon to find some, or consider getting help from a counselor. Be well,Robin Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC'),('Q_117','M2',' I am sorry for the pain you are experiencing.

What would you say to a friend who was going through the same thing? Would you berate them or would you be understanding and supportive? Try to treat yourself with the same kindness and compassion you would show to a friend. Forgiving yourself is a process, and it takes time. Don\'t expect to feel better overnight.

Boy, ending relationshipsÂ is tough, isn\'t it? Sometimes it\'s tough even when we are 100% sure that it is the right thing to do!I am going to give you some of my thoughts, and hopefully some colleagues will add some others. One of the things that I want to point out is that \"letting go\" is not really a thing. In other words, it\'s not really something you can reach out and grab. It\'s more of a process. This is good news, because you don\'t necessarily have to be atÂ the end of the process to end an unhealthy relationship. We just have to accept that there will be feelings that come up even after the relationship is over. For example, someone can end an unhealthy relationship today, but then be reminded of the good times on what wouldÂ have been their \"anniversary.\" This could make the person very sad. They may even regret ending the relationship for a little while. It would important, then, for the person to remind themselves why the relationship needed to end, and that they are healthier because of it. This is relevant for you. It\'s hard to walk away from a relationship. We fear all kinds of things, including being single! Sometimes it\'s helpful to compare what you are getting out of the relationship to what you want from a relationship. It\'s helpful to be honest about what we have given up for an unhealthy relationship. It\'s fine to admit uncertainly about ending things. It\'s okay to be afraid. It\'s okay to have moments of doubt and sadness along with a dash of guilt. And even with all of that,Â someoneÂ can still leave if it is the healthiest thing for them. They can have sadness later on, and still not go back.It sounds like you are feeling responsible for making sure he is okay because of this divorce. The truth is that there is not necessarily a \"perfect\" time to end any relationship. There would be no guarantee that he would be doing any better after the divorce.

I agree with Sherry that being patient with yourself is important. Here are a few things I would suggest:1. Get clear on the behaviors you really want to change, and make sure they are behaviors that CAN be changed. Sometimes we will set a goal like, \"I want to be more confident\" but that is hard to measure and prove to yourself that you accomplished it. Saying you are going to accept a date or go on a job interview is something you can actually do, and something that you may consider to be demonstrating confidence. Whatever your change of behavior is, make sure it is something you can actually change. 2. If you are going to give up a behavior, decide what you are going to do in place of it. So, if you are going to stop showing up late for work, then you are deciding to be on time for work and demonstrating your value of being punctual. 3. If you are going to make changes, really nail down WHY you want to make them. What is it about making these changes that is important to you as a person? For example, if you have the goal of weight loss, the reason this is important to you as a person may be because you value self-care. Knowing WHY you want to make changes is both your motivation and your compass for getting there. 4. Once you know WHY you want to make these changes, I strongly suggest setting small goals. If you set too high of goals you may not accomplish them and just feel worse. So, make the goal small, realistic, and guided by the the things you want to be as a person. 5.

A therapist can help you to process your emotions and work through the challenges of your situation. It may also be helpful to seek out a support group for parents who are going through a divorce. This can be a great way to connect with others who are going through similar experiences and to gain support and advice from others who have been in your shoes.'),('Q_149','M0','Houston, It\'s normal for this kind of thing to be a trigger, so I get why you don\'t want to sit on it, but to keep refusing keeps the affair alive. Am I to assume that you can\'t afford a new one?

It sounds like you feel like she violated your trust and that sitting on the couch is a reminder of that. However, you are also saying that you love, laugh, and play with her, which is great! Ã‚Â If you\'re able to move on from the infidelity, then it might be worth talking to your wife about how you feel about sitting on the couch. Explain to her that it\'s a reminder of her betrayal and that you\'re not sure if you\'ll ever be able to get comfortable sitting there again. She may be able to understand this and work with you to find a solution that works for both of you.'),('Q_149','M4','I\'m glad you\'re able to see the situation clearly.

Â It DOESN\'T necessarily mean, however that your husband is: gay, bisexual transgender, or even necessarily a cross-dresser etc. unless he has already told you so. I agree with the other poster who recommended you try and ask him more questions with an open and curious attitude and see if he might be open to explaining more with you.Â That being said, what we also know from research is that frequently what turns us on isn\'t always what we identify as. Â Lots of people have fantasies or even sexual behaviors they may enjoy from time to time without considering themselves to be a part of any label or subculture. For example, many women are okay with having their hair pulled or bottom spanked during a particular rowdy sexual encounter but certainly don\'t consider themselves kinky, submissive, or anything else. Â It could be that your husband enjoys pretending/ fantasizing that he is something completely different in the bedroom from time to time from what most other see him as outside in the corporate world or in other roles he plays as husband, father, son, friend etc. Â Many of my kink clients are drawn to their particular fetish simply because it\'s the opposite of what their life typically entails (e.g., a high profile CEO who is always responsible for making the decisions enjoys being at \"the mercy\" of someone else once a week).Â Each of us has a sexual script - a blueprint if you will of what we like and don\'t like in the bedroom and also what we have each come to see as being \"normal.\" Â It\'s also an internal guideline for how we each define our role in sexual expression, sexual orientation, sexual behaviors, sexual desires, and how big a part our sexual identity plays in our everyday lives (Gagnon & Simon, 1973).You\'ve been clued into the fact that your husbands greatly differs from yours on the surface level at the moment.Â ALL of us are sexual beings yet none of us is exactly identical to one another in our sexual definitions and script expectations. It\'s like our own sex fingerprint.Â In my role as a couples counselor, I often help partners become aware of their own sexual script and explore where it overlaps their partners and where it may always differ. Â If a couple is able to successfully navigate formulating a plan for both to feel validated and sexually satisfied, the relationship thrives.Â Most counselors would agree that a healthy script includes:Both partners taking ownership for the couple\'s sexual experiences.Both partners learning to communicate openly and honestly about their feelings.Both partners learning to meet one another\'s - needs, desires, and wishes while making sure his/her own needs are being met.If \"pegging\" your husband as it\'s called is a hard and fast no for you, that will likely need to be respected as it may be too far off your own sexual script. Â However, if your husband is for sure absolutely adamant about \"needing\" to dress in a female fashion and/or be anally penetrated, you may seek professional counseling to help navigate how both of you will come to an agreement about fulfilling these desires in a way that doesn\'t hurt either one of you or the marriage.My warmest wishes to you both!'),('Q_150','M2',' It sounds like you know what you want, and it\'s okay to say no to the things you don\'t want. It\'s okay to feel uncomfortable with certain requests. I think it would be beneficial to have a conversation with your partner, where you sit down and talk about what you both want and need. It\'s important to be open and honest with each other, so that you can create a relationship that is healthy and fulfilling for both of you.'),('Q_150','M3',' Are you interested in continuing this relationship? If so, it is important to determine whether or not you can come to a suitable compromise with your partner. You do not have to do anything that you do not want to do.

Additionally, you may want to consider whether you are comfortable with your partner wearing makeup and heels. If you are not, you may want to discuss this with your partner as well. It is important to remember that you do not have to have sex with your partner if you do not want to.'),('Q_150','M4','I\'m not sure if you are saying that you don\'t like it or that you don\'t like him.

It is important to remember that you have the right to say no to anything that you don\'t want to do. If you are feeling pressured to do something that you don\'t want to do, it is important to speak up and let the other person know how you feel. If the other person continues to pressure you, it may be necessary to seek help from a trusted adult or counselor. Remember, you are not alone and there are people who can help you. You deserve to be treated with respect and kindness, and you have the right to say no to anything that you don\'t want to do. I hope that you are able to find the support that you need.'),('Q_151','M0','It can absolutely be normal for men to fantasize about sexual activities with other men! Fantasy can be an incredibly fulfilling experience for you and your partner! This could be a aspect of your sexuality that you would benefit from exploring thorough conversation with trusted someone, like your spouse or close friend (or therapist). Depending on your current relationship, would you be comfortable discussing this with your spouse?Â Also, please understand that this likely has nothing to do with your gender identity as one therapist posted here.

The American Society of Addiction Medicine defines addiction as \"a treatable, chronic medical disease involving complex interactions among brain circuits, genetics, the environment, and an individual\'s life experiences. People with addiction use substances or engage in behaviors that become compulsive and often continue despite harmful consequences.\" Notice that nothing in the definition speaks about willpower or motivation. That\'s because addiction is a disease - just like diabetes or high blood pressure. Imagine I gave a huge piece of chocolate cake to a diabetic. After he eats the cake, I say to him \"Use your willpower to lower your glucose to 100.\" Do you think he would be successful?Â All addictions are behaviors. Behavior can be understood in terms of function and reinforcement. All behavior is either an attempt to get something or an attempt to get away from something. If you apply this logic to addictive behaviors, the use of mood-altering substances is an attempt to create a particular feeling or emotion, or an attempt to numb one. When a behavior is reinforced, we are more likely to engage in the same behavior again in the future. Let\'s assume that I\'m feeling very anxious. I drink some alcohol and notice that my anxiety decreases. My brain takes note of this and the next time I\'m feeling anxious I am more likely to reach for a bottle. Now, imagine this happening hundreds, if not thousands, of times.Â Â Addiction recovery is about identifying and treating the underlying reasons for the use. A qualified addiction therapist will assist you in developing a relapse prevention plan that addresses these underlying issues and helps you to identify triggers for your use. Additionally, you will learn how to avoid triggers and gain healthy coping skills to use instead of relying on alcohol.Â I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors.

My family offers little to no support. They think it\'s fake or \"all in my head.\" It makes me feel guilty and at times depressed to the point where I\'d rather never wake up anymore. I am not self-harming, I just feel meaningless. This constant fear has taken over my thoughts and my life. I was such a happy person. I want my life back.

I try to be happy for them, but I get really upset every time they hook up.',0),(8,'Q_124','I want a secure relationship with someone that wants to be with me and who will actually put effort into it.\n I seem to gravitate toward unavailable men and those that want intimacy and no relationship. I let men dictate and control me because they accuse me of being controlling. I let men emotionally abuse me and I am at their beck and call.\n I am not comfortable being alone or doing anything by myself. I feel I need the security of someone being around just to survive. I know what I\'m doing wrong and I do it anyway just hoping things will change. How do I stop this behavior and thought process?',0),(8,'Q_125','My ex-girlfriend says she\'s bored and wants to experience life single.

I am very aware of the problem and try to talk myself out of it all the time, but I never seem to shake the habits. I try to think of what it is doing to me and my future, but no matter what, I keep creating excuses for myself to continue the procrastination. All I\'m ever left with is regrets and a low grade. I am at an all-time low in my life, and I\'m not even that old. I\'ve always been a straight-A student, but now I\'m getting C\'s and F\'s, and it hurts me to know that I am way better than that.

He decided he didn\'t want to be with her anymore when the child was an infant.    It seems to me that there is a pattern. He easily detaches from relationships at the same time in the child\'s life but wants a relationship with them when they are older. I\'ve tried to research online, but I\'m not getting any answers. He also has an unhealthy dependency on alcohol and does not believe in mental health disorders such as depression and bi-polar disorder.

Nothing I do is right, and once she\'s mad, she calls me all kinds of names and is verbally abusive. She says it isn’t abuse, it’s just angry verbal bashing, and that it’s different.

My boyfriend is a Christian teenager too, but things just got out of hand between us in a sexual manner. I planned to abstain from sex but I guess I wasn\'t clear about this because I was also tempted and led him on. We continued to have sex. Does it mean that he isn\'t the one God planned for me?
